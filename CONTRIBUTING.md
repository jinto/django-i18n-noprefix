### Development Setup

### Code Style

- We use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting
- We use [Ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff) for linting
- Maximum line length is 88 characters
- Type hints are encouraged for better code clarity

Run formatters before committing:
```bash
make format  # Or manually:
black .
ruff check . --fix
```

Pre-commit hooks will automatically check code style:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### CI/CD Process

All pull requests are automatically tested with:

1. **Test Matrix**: Python 3.8-3.12 Ã— Django 4.2-5.1
2. **Code Quality**: Black, Ruff, MyPy
3. **Coverage**: Minimum 70% code coverage required
4. **Pre-commit**: All hooks must pass

#### GitHub Actions Workflows

- **Tests** (`test.yml`): Runs on every push and PR
- **Code Quality** (`quality.yml`): Checks code style and linting
- **Dependabot**: Weekly dependency updates

#### Local Testing

Test against specific Python/Django versions:
```bash
# Test with specific Django version
pip install "Django~=5.0.0"
pytest

# Run the same checks as CI
make test
make lint
make typecheck
```
